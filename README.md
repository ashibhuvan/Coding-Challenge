Tesla Email Coding challenge --> You had only 60 minutes to finish the challenge.  
The questions and my solutions are in the questions.py file.  
This was for a specific department/team so if you come across this do not think it will be give to you, maybe.  
note: I think this was for internship positions. I did not focus on run time or other complexities so take my solutions with a grain of salt as they are not optimized at all.
